# Pokemon Team Builder

Hi! This is my first attempt to creating a react app. Bootstrapped with the Create-React-App, I'm trying to create a Pokemon Team Builder with a built in PokeDex you could use to search for pokemon.

This app is currently a work-in-progress and is live at [Demo] (https://jaikun12.github.io/pokemon-team-builder/)

## Assets
Assets are obtained from the following sources:
[Pokedex Background] (https://hatirem.deviantart.com/art/Pokedex-template-568334471)
[Sprites] (https://pokeapi.co)

## Known Bugs
..*Pokemon could only be searched in lowercase input.

## Target Features
<input type="checkbox" checked>PokeDex integrated to PokeApi</input>
<input type="checkbox">Save pokemons to lineup</input>
<input type="checkbox">Modify individual pokemons from lineup</input>
